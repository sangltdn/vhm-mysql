This is a virtual host manager for the Apache Mysql Vhost config located here: http://wiki.apache.org/httpd/ApacheVirtualHostMysql

It is currently working on windows, mac and linux.

I (Jorge Schrauwen) will not continue to work on it. Currently it works and does what I wanted it to do. I may update it when a modified version or changes are made to the wiki article to keep it functioning.

Anybody that is interested in maintaining or expanding it can contact me.

Bug fixes are ofcourse welcome too, if you find bugs and can't fix them yourself Notify me as well. If I have time they may get fixed too.

I again I would like to draw your attention to that fact that although this program is provided as a tool for an article on the Apache HTTPD wiki that this is not related to the ASF (Nor am I for that matter - aside from the fact the I hang out in #apache a lot ;))
